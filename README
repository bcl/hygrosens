This is my first pass at a library for the Hygrosens sensor devices
available from http://www.hygrosens.com

The code works, but documentation in this initial release is sparse.


Requirements
------------
pyserial module from pyserial.sourceforge.net
distutils (usually included with python)


Installation
------------
Install the library by running:

su -c 'python setup.py install'

You must have Python distutils installed for this to work.


Usage
-----

Look at the code in the examples directory. It shows how to use the library
to read the sensors and how to stuff the data into a MySQL database.


More documentation will follow soon.
